	- fix bug in mkreport() processing of MUNGE_CALLBACK (would not change report values).

	*** This entailed a change _non_ backward compatible change in the MUNGE_CALLBACK interface.
	*** Client code that calls the alter->() callback _requires_ changing.
	*** The alter callback is now called with one parm, a ref to a hash of the field values
	*** indexed by field name. See examples/ for scripts that have been changed.
 
	- added to_dbh() method to allow DBD::AnyData provided use of SQL (simple) on report data
	- added primitive support for chart templates to excel_dump. The workbook written by
	Spreadsheet::WriteExcel can contain _one_ (1) chart of the avail data.
