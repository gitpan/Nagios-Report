Some of the code in this directory runs the avail.cgi program to get the
Nagios availability report.

This code needs to be changed to set 

  1 the Nagios server
  2 the Authorised user

to values appropriate for you.

Code that needs changing is that which uses the 'local_cgi' tag in the constructor eg

Nagios_Availability_Report-MTD
Nagios_Availability_Report-MTD_chart
ex4b
ex4b_e
ex5
ex5c
ex5c_last12hours
ex5d
host_down_report
host_down_report_by_start_down_csv
host_down_report_with_links
load_month_avail_records
sql_ex1
sql_ex2
svc_rep
svc_rep_2
svc_rep_3
svc_rep_4

eg perl -i.bak -pe 's/Nagios_Server/YOUR_SERVER/; s/Auth_Nagios_User/YOU/' host_down_report

This code also needs changing. It gets the availability report from the CGI web page so
it needs to have the authentication token of the Authorised User added after the username.

ex1e
ex1f
ex5e

eg eg perl -i.bak -pe 's/Nagios_Server/YOUR_SERVER/; s/Auth_Nagios_User/YOU/; s/Auth_PW/YourPW/' ex1e

The code that does NOT need modifying is that which uses the 'dev_debug' tag in
the constructor eg

ex1
ex1a
ex1b
ex1c
ex1d
ex2
ex3
ex4
ex4a
ex5_comp_by_hostname_down
ex5_comp_by_hostname_up
ex5_comp_by_max_downtime_down
ex5_comp_by_max_downtime_up
ex5a
ex5a_Test
ex5b
ex_iterator
